Customer Behavior Intelligence System
A complete AI-driven system that segments users, classifies new users, and predicts expected spending based on behavioral data.
The project applies unsupervised clustering (K-Means), classification (Random Forest), and regression (Linear Regression/XGBoost) models, with clear visualizations and business insights.
It demonstrates the full data science workflow â€” from raw data to deployable intelligence.
